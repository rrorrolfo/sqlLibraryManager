<p align="center">Dynamic web application designed for a library to help manage a collection of books. This web application includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books. </p>

<h2 align="center">How it is built</h2>
<p> This project was built using `Node.js` on the `Express` framework for the backend and error handling. Sequelize ORM is used for communicating and manipulating data with an SQLite database, and Sequelizes validation methods are used for validating form submissions. `Pug` templates are used to create the views and vanilla `Javascript` is used to add search and pagination functionality. Finally this web application is styled using CSS3. </p>
